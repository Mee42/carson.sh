Using git properly is important.","tags":["unreleased"],"url":"how-not-to-mess-up-git","date":"2020-08-21","content":"Git is hard! A lot of people I know only know a couple git commands\r\n```\r\n$ git add -A .\r\n$ git commit -m $message\r\n$ git checkout $branch\r\n$ git push origin $branch\r\n```\r\nand while this works for 90% of all work done on git, it's woefully incompetent at the other 10%: fixing shit when it breaks.\r\n\r\n*Now, just to note, git rarely \"breaks\". It's almost always the developer doing something they shoudn't have.*\r\n\r\nThis document is going te be a brief summary on some major misconceptions of Git, and then some specific helpful examples that I've needed to use in my time working with Git, or helping other people with them.\r\n\r\n## What branches are\r\n\r\nBranches are reference to commits. To rephrase that, a branch is just a pointers to a specific commit.\r\n\r\nWhen you are working in git, you have this reference called HEAD, which refers to the current working commit.\r\nYou are always \"on\" a specific commit, which is reflected in the current state of the source code.\r\nWith git the was you change between commits is the `git checkout` command.\r\n\r\nThere's also \"detached head\" state, where you do not live on a branch but instead a specific commit, named by its hash. This is unusual, but worth noting.\r\n\r\n**A key point here is that branches don't technically have multiple commits.**\r\n\r\nBranches are a single commit, and each commit is some changes plus it's parent(s).\r\nHere's a quick example:\r\n```\r\n a -\u003e b -\u003e c -\u003e d     \u003c--- master\r\n      \\\r\n       \\--\u003e e -\u003e f    \u003c--- dev\r\n```\r\n`a` is the initial commit. For the purpose of this page, there is only ever one inital commit - while there can be others, merging them isn't really done.\r\n\r\nYou might look at this and say \"okay, well, `e` is on the `dev` branch. And, you'd be almost correct.\r\nWhile dev does encompase `e`, and `e` is \"on dev\", the `e` commit contains exactly zero information about the `dev` branch. \r\nYou can see that in the next step:\r\n```\r\n a -\u003e b -\u003e c -\u003e d -----\u003e g    \u003c--- master\r\n      \\                 /\\\r\n       \\--\u003e e -\u003e f -----/\r\n```\r\nIn this step, we merged dev into `g` with a merge commit.\r\n\r\nNow what branch is `e` on? It's actually on master - but when you commited, you commited to dev!\r\nDoing a very basic `git log` will just show you `g, f, d, e, c, b, a`, which has no way to tell the difference between commits done on dev and commits done on master.\r\n\r\nThis could be an issue if you wanted to have broken code on dev (say commit `e` doesn't work), and now all the sudden it's on master! Some git loggers will properly split the commits so they visually appear on a different history path then the master branch, but they're still 100% on the master branch without the context of dev.\r\n\r\n## Some common Git problems\r\n\r\n#### I made a commit to the wrong branch!\r\n```\r\na -\u003e b -\u003e c   \u003c--- master\r\n```\r\nWhoops, you wanted to make the `c` commit on `dev`! This happens to me at least once a week.\r\nThe fix is easy, but you have to be careful because it involves rewriting history.\r\n```\r\n$ git reset --soft HEAD~1\r\n```\r\nThis will reset your git repo to `HEAD~1` (meaning the commit before `HEAD`), but because it's a `--soft` reset, it'll keep all the changes in that commit and put them back into staging. Then you can\r\n```\r\n$ git checkeout -b dev\r\n$ git commit\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### I made a commit to the wrong branch and pushed it!\r\n\r\nFirst, check with everyone who works on the project to make sure they haven't touched anything yet.\r\nIf they haven't, you can delete the `c` commit on master with a force push\r\n```\r\n$ git push --force origin master\r\n```\r\nHowever, this is *not good* and should be avoided if possible. Branch protection rules are offered by GitHub and GitLab, use them if you need to.\r\n\r\n#### I made a commit and now there's a merge conflict"},{"id":4,"title":"Some thoughts on optimization","desc":"A short introduction to basic optimization","tags":["compilers","optimization"],"url":"optimization-thoughts","date":"2020-10-21","content":"# Optimization Thoughts\r\n\r\nOptimization is a large topic, and only some basics are going to be covered here.\r\nWe'll be talking about *AST optimizations* today, as it's the most universal form of optimization, independent of backend.\r\n\r\nAn AST is an *Abstract Syntax Tree*. This is just how a compiler represents the source code in memory. While we'll being doing a lot of Source Code to Source Code changes for each optimization step, keep in mind that there are not stringy values being manipulated, but a more efficient tree data structure. For the sake of this page, we'll just be working with readable source code.\r\n\r\nLet's take a very simple program\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n     val a = 7\r\n     var c = a\r\n     c += 1\r\n     val b = a*2 + foo(a) + c\r\n     if(b \u003c a) error(\"reached illegal state\")\r\n     while(b \u003e c) c+=c; // do some fun doubling\r\n     println(a + b + c);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfun foo(i: Int): Int {\r\n    return if(i \u003c 2) 19 else 18;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, let's optimize this down:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Constant Value Propagation\r\n\r\nConstant Value Propagation, or CVP for short on this page, is taking values that are constant (or static) and propagating them across the program. It's effectively inlining variables that have constant, known values. For example,\r\n```kt\r\nval a = 7\r\nval b = a\r\nval c = a + a\r\n```\r\ncan just be\r\n```kt\r\nval a = 7\r\nval b = 7\r\nval c = 7 + 7\r\n```\r\nThis is powerful because it eliminates the overhead of fetching variables like constants. This doesn't seem *that* helpful at first, but it becomes much more useful when combined with other optimizations.\r\n\r\nOne shortcoming of CVP is that it requires all values to be known at compile time, and for all values to be stored in **final**, or constant variables, so they do not change.\r\n\r\nLet's put our example program through some constant value propagation.\r\n\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n     val a = 7 // this is able to be propagated easily\r\n     var c = 7 // this is not, as it is mutable (it might change). However, we still inline the 7 from 'a'\r\n     c += 1\r\n     val b = 7*2 + foo(7) + c // here we inline the value for 'a'\r\n     if(b \u003c 7) error(\"reached illegal state\") // everywhere we use 'a' we can replace it with 7\r\n     while(b \u003e c) c+=c; \r\n     println(7 + b + c);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expression Folding\r\n\r\nExpression Folding is pretty simple: pure operations, like arithmetics on pure expressions, can be done at compile time. \r\nPurity in this context means it doesn't matter if it's actually evaluated at runtime; \r\n`print(4)` is *impure*, because if you removed it, the program would work differently. \r\nA *pure* expression can be removed without affecting the program, \r\n`7 + 8` does not need to be computed at runtime if the program does not use the resulting sum. \r\nThere's also no need to do `2+2` at runtime when the compiler can just insert `4`, because addition is pure.\r\nGiven this, we can somewhat reduce the amount of computation we'll do at compile time. In each of theses steps, we'll be continuing on from the function before it, so the input to this optimization step is the outputted function above from Constant Value Propagation.\r\n\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n     val a = 7 \r\n     var c = 7 \r\n     c += 1\r\n     val b = 14 + foo(7) + c  // '7*2' can be changed to '14'\r\n     if(b \u003c 7) error(\"reached illegal state\")\r\n     while(b \u003e c) c+=c; \r\n     println(7 + b + c);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is again, something that isn't very helpful without some other optimizations, which we'll get to below.\r\n\r\n### Inlining of functions\r\n\r\nWe can inline short functions into the original source code. This can sometimes increase execution speed for a couple reasons: The basic improvement is that we don't need to store the arguments, call, return, and get back the result. This is generally a smaller increase in speed, and is pretty much only important on short functions like `abs` or `max`, where the call overhead is comparable to the actual functionality.\r\n\r\nThe more important thing is that it brings more context into the caller function for the compiler to work with. Inlining lets the compiler optimize the callee in the context of the caller, instead of optimizing them separately. \r\n\r\nLets inline `foo` into our original function.\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n     val a = 7 \r\n     var c = 7 \r\n     c += 1\r\n     val b = 14 + block@ {\r\n         val i = 7\r\n         return@block if(i \u003c 2) 19 else 18\r\n     }() + c\r\n     if(b \u003c 7) error(\"reached illegal state\")\r\n     while(b \u003e c) c+=c; \r\n     println(7 + b + c);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is getting into some more complex Kotlin syntax, but you can think of it like a block (several statements) being used as an expression. The `block@` allows it to return the value locally. As an example,\r\n```kt\r\nblock@ { return@block 1 + 20 } + 300\r\n```\r\nwould evaluate to `321`\r\n\r\nYou can see how we set `i` to the value we passed in for `i` in the original function, `7`.\r\n\r\nNow, we can optimize this further with expression folding and constant value propagation. We'll look at just the block for a second.\r\n```kt\r\nblock@ {\r\n    val i = 7\r\n    return@block if(7 \u003c 2) 19 else 18\r\n}()\r\n```\r\n\r\n `if(7 \u003c 2)` will clearly fold down to `true`, so we can simplify just down to `19`.\r\n ```kt\r\n block@ {\r\n     val i = 7\r\n     return@block 19\r\n }()\r\n ```\r\n Because this is kotlin, we can optimize `block@ { return@block 19 }` down to `19`. This gives us, back to our original function.\r\n ```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n     val a = 7 \r\n     var c = 7 \r\n     c += 1\r\n     val b = 14 + 19 + c // note the 19 here\r\n     if(b \u003c 7) error(\"reached illegal state\")\r\n     while(b \u003e c) c+=c; \r\n     println(7 + b + c);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we can fold some more! \r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    val a = 7 \r\n    var c = 7\r\n    c += 1\r\n    val b = 23 + c // added 14 and 19 together\r\n    if(b \u003c 7) error(\"reached illegal state\")\r\n    while(b \u003e c) c+=c; \r\n    println(7 + b + c);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this is great and all, but it isn't perfect. You or me could optimize this better, so we're going to need a couple more tools. \r\n\r\n### Dead Code Elimination\r\n\r\nDead Code Elimination, or DCE, is removing code that does nothing. This is a pretty simple reducement of the code\r\n- If a variable is not used, it can be reduced to the expression it's set to\r\n```kt\r\nval a = 7 + b// can turn to\r\n7 + b // just sitting there\r\n```\r\n- If an expression is not used, and it is pure, it can be deleted\r\n```kt\r\n7 // would be allowed to deleted\r\n```\r\n- If an expression is not used, and the outer layer is pure, the outer layer can be deleted\r\n```kt\r\nfoo() + bar() // if this exists, and is not used, it can be optimized to\r\nfoo(); bar() // with no add\r\n```\r\n- If some code is unreachable, it can be deleted. This one we won't touch on today as it's more language-specific\r\n```kt\r\nreturn 7\r\nprint(\"hi!\") // this line can be deleted as it will never be reached\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these rules, we can delete the `a` variable from our program, and it's value `7` as it's pure.\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    // no more a lol\r\n    var c = 7 \r\n    c += 1\r\n    val b = 23 + c\r\n    if(b \u003c 7) error(\"reached illegal state\")\r\n    while(b \u003e c) c+=c; \r\n    println(7 + b + c);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this is pretty nice. However, it's not *that* good. It could be much better. And to do that, we're going to need some better tools\r\n\r\n### Static Single Assignment Form\r\n\r\nAlso known as SSA, this one is rather hard to implement in compilers. However, we'll give it a go.\r\n\r\nSSA is the idea \"what if, every variable was final, and we just made a new variable every single time we assigned it?\"\r\n\r\nFor example, a trivial program like\r\n```kt\r\nvar foo = 7\r\nfoo += foo*foo\r\n```\r\nmight look hard to optimize logically. If we use SSA, though, we get\r\n```kt\r\nval foo_0 = 7\r\nval foo_1 = foo_0 + foo_0 * foo_0\r\n```\r\nwhich can be optimized down to a perfect constant, `val foo_1 = 56`, trivially with the above methods. \r\n\r\nLet's run our program through SSA.\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    val c_0 = 7\r\n    c_1 = c_0 + 1\r\n    val b = 23 + c_1\r\n    if(b \u003c 7) error(\"reached illegal state\")\r\n    while(b \u003e c) c+=c; // wait a minute, what do we do here?\r\n    println(7 + b + c);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe answer is that we make a very fancy control flow graph, which recurs on itself, and has a finite amount of c_n variables.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is hard! We're going to skip that for now, and introduce a `c_mut` variable for when we need to do that\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    val c_0 = 7\r\n    val c_1 = c_0 + 1\r\n    val b = 23 + c_1\r\n    if(b \u003c 7) error(\"reached illegal state\")\r\n    var c_mut = c_1\r\n    while(b \u003e c_mut) c_mut+=c_mut\r\n    println(7 + b + c_mut);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you can see here it's trivial to evaluate large amounts of this code\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    val c_0 = 7\r\n    val c_1 = 7 + 1 // c_0 can be rolled into here, so we should really do\r\n    val c_1 = 8\r\n    val b = 23 + c_1 // we can also evaluate this simply, and we should actually just do\r\n    val b = 31 // 2^5-1, nice\r\n    if(31 \u003c 7) error(\"reached illegal state\") // DCE can delete this statement as it'll never run, as well as the 'if' statement\r\n    var c_mut = c_1; // we'll wait on optimizing this for a bit\r\n    while(31 \u003e c_mut) c_mut+=c_mut\r\n    println(7 + 31 + c_mut); // inlining of b, should really be\r\n    println(38 + c_mut) // evaluating the addition\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat was a big mess of duplicate lines, so let's rewrite that\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    val c_0 = 7\r\n    val c_1 = 8\r\n    val b = 31\r\n    var c_mut = c_1; // we'll wait on optimizing this for a bit\r\n    while(31 \u003e c_mut) c_mut+=c_mut\r\n    println(38 + c_mut) // evaluating the addition\r\n}\r\n```\r\nLet's run DCE real quick, as we can delete `c_0`, `c_1`, and `b`.\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    var c_mut = 8; // we'll wait on optimizing this for a bit\r\n    while(31 \u003e c_mut) c_mut+=c_mut\r\n    println(38 + c_mut)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this is pretty damn good, what we've done already. \r\nHowever, because I added this at the beginning, I feel obligated to finish it off :p\r\n\r\n### How (not really) to do loops in SSA\r\n\r\nLet's make an assumption that normal compilers are unable to make: that the loop will terminate within 5 iterations.\r\nThis is the only way to solve this without a nice, recursive graph, which is hard to represent in a textual format.\r\nThis is *not* how this is done in actual compilers.\r\n\r\nSo, let's think about how we can remove this loop. We need to remember how while loops actually flow.\r\n```\r\n               /----------false-------\\       \r\nstart -\u003e conditional ---true--\u003e body-\u003e \\---\u003e rest of the program\r\n            /\\                  /\r\n             \\-----------------/\r\n```\r\nIf we want to remove the recursive structure here, we could do it manually just by repeating the conditional. Here's a loop that runs max 2 iterations\r\n```\r\n               /-------false------------------------------------------------\\/\r\nstart -\u003e conditional --true--\u003e body -\u003e conditional --true--\u003e body -------\u003e rest of the program\r\n                                            \\--------false------------------/\\\r\n```\r\nWe could model this with an `if` statement,\r\n```kt\r\nif(cond) {\r\n    body\r\n    if(cond) {\r\n        body\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nKnowing this, we can change our original program (*again, you need to remember that this only works when we have a small upper iteration limit*)\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    val c_10 = 8;\r\n    if(c_10 \u003c 31) {\r\n        val c_11 = c_10 + c_10\r\n        if(c_11 \u003c 31) {\r\n            val c_12 = c_11 + c_12\r\n            if(c_12 \u003c 31) {\r\n                val c_13 = c_12 + c_12\r\n                if(c_13 \u003c 31) {\r\n                    val c_14 = c_13 + c_13\r\n                    // at this point, c_14 is \u003c31 (as per our assumption)\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    // we still have an issue here, what variable do we print here?\r\n    println(38 + c_???)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe answer to the `c_???` question is: there's not a great way to figure this out. Again, normal ~~people~~ compilers would use proper SSA and not have this problem. We'll just.. ignore it for now. The answer will be obvious after some - you guessed it! - expression folding and variable inlining.\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    val c_10 = 8;\r\n    if(/*c_10 \u003c 31*/ true) {\r\n        //val c_11 = 8 + 8\r\n        val c_11 = 16\r\n        if(/*c_11 \u003c 31*/ true) {\r\n            // val c_12 = 16 + 16\r\n            val c_12 = 32\r\n            if(/*c_12 \u003c 31*/ false) {\r\n                /*val c_13 = c_12 + c_12 \r\n                if(c_13 \u003c 31) {          // all of this can be deleted as the 'if' statement will evaluate to false, via DCE\r\n                    val c_14 = c_13 + c_13\r\n                }*/\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    println(38 + c_???)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWith SSA, the lines between scopes are blurred\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    val c_10 = 8\r\n    val c_11 = 16\r\n    val c_12 = 32\r\n    println(38 + c_???)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI guess we can assume our `c_???` to be `c_12`, as it's the last version of `c` ever set (remember that these are still just `c` in the original function), which gives us\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    val c_10 = 8\r\n    val c_11 = 16\r\n    val c_12 = 32\r\n    println(38 + 32)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n...DCE\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    println(38 + 32)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n...folding\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n    println(70)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWoo! We've perfectly optimized this program, in a logical process. For reference, here's the original function.\r\n```kt\r\nfun main() {\r\n     val a = 7\r\n     var c = a\r\n     c += 1\r\n     val b = a*2 + foo(a) + c\r\n     if(b \u003c a) error(\"reached illegal state\")\r\n     while(b \u003e c) c+=c; // do some fun doubling\r\n     println(a + b + c);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfun foo(i: Int): Int {\r\n    return if(i \u003c 2) 19 else 18;\r\n}\r\n```"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog","query":{},"buildId":"5E8jP6WnT-FKjj4CjBSlS","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
