They sold like, half a million of these fancy beige boxes.\n\nAnd I've got one of them!\n\n(image)\n\nIt's not mine to keep, but a friend aquired one from a relative, and that's good enough for me.\nThe issue starts when we turn it on...\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"/line.jpg\" title=\"Carson hoodie reveal????\">\n    <figcaption>After turning it on.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIt's a line! Unless you're a [Flatland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland) fan,\nthis clearly isn't a functional computer. However, this isn't an issue you'll see on any modern computer - it's an issue with the [Cathode-Ray Tube (CRT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube) display used on the Mac.\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Cathode_ray_Tube.PNG\"\n         title=\"What would we do without stock wikipedia diagrams\"/>\n    <figcaption>\n    By <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Theresa_knott\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:User:Theresa knott\">Theresa Knott</a> - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Cathode_ray_Tube.PNG\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"en:Image:Cathode ray Tube.PNG\">en:Image:Cathode ray Tube.PNG</a>, <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\" title=\"Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\">CC BY-SA 3.0</a>, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=100143\">Link</a>\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe deflection coils (Magnets!) \"bend\" the electrons shot from the electron gun (The Cathode)\nto hit the right spot screen, which (coated in phosphor) emits light when hit by electrons.\n\nThere's two sets of deflection coils, one to control the horizontal bending and one to control the vertical bending of the electrons. Looking at the signals, they should look both *something* like a sawtooth, going from top to bottom (or left to right) slowly while sending the electrons and then \"jumping\" back to the start to repeat the process. \n\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"https://www.eevblog.com/forum/repair/help-fixing-a-crt-terminal/?action=dlattach;attach=1217909;image\"\n         title=\"I need to figure out how to take multimeter screenshots that look this pretty\"/>\n    <figcaption>\n<a href=\"https://www.eevblog.com/forum/repair/help-fixing-a-crt-terminal/50/\">Stolen from a webpage about repairing CRTS</a>    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThat's what the **horizontal** sweep *should* look like (or, some noisy derivative of it, doesn't particularly matter).\nHowever, when probing the wire going directly from the Analog Control Board to the magnet coils, we see something a bit different.\n\n\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"/oscope.jpg\"\n  alt=\"A picture of a Mac Classic\"\n  title=\"It kinda looks like McDonalds.\">\n  <figcaption>\n    Probing the wire going to the horizontal yoke on the CRT. I don't know why they're called yokes, don't ask me.\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n(You might see the voltage is up in the hundreds. The electron gun itself runs at about 860.\nPropery safety is a vital part of every hobbiest electrician's toolkit something something something - \nI highly recommend high voltage gloves. 10mA through your heart is instant death)\n\nThis is a weird graph. I literally have no clue why it's like this,\nbut I think it explains why the line across the screen doesn't fully reach the edges.\nWe'll come back to this.\n\n\nThe **vertical** sweep, on the other hand, has no signal on it whatsoever.\nI would include the picture, but it's literally a horizontal line.\nThis explains why the CRT is drawing a line across the screen -\nit just paints every single row of the screen, on the single row in the middle.\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n\nAccording to the Internet, these capacitors on these fucking machines just kill themselves after like a decade, and it's a miracle that this machine is still turning on at all.\nFucking Apple, man. I think I'm going to have to buy new caps, desolder the old ones and install new ones\non both the Logic Board and the Analog Power Board.\n\n\n-----------\n\nTo be continued, hopefully the new capacitors + new cmos battery fixes the CRT issues."}},"__N_SSG":true}
