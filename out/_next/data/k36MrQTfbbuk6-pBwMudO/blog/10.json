I'm Carson\n\n\nYou can reach me at <a href=\"mailto:carson42g@gmail.com\">carson42g@gmail.com</a> or `@mr_arson` on Discord. If your contact for me is `cjgraham@wpi.edu`, you should try one of the above - I've recently graduated from WPI (B.S in Computer Science) and they won't let me keep my email.\n\nI got a degree in computer science, which allegedly makes me a software engineer, but I'm also an electrical engineer, firmware developer, and hobbyist mechanical engineer/machinist/woodworker/sysadmin/compiler developer, among other thing. Given this, I'm employed as a cyber security research scientist in the Northern Virginia area \n\nIn college I ran 10 person FSAE electrical team and built a kickass electric car\n\n![](/img/fsae/car_jeevan.png)\n*Higher torque-to-weight than any production Porsche*\n\nIf I'm not responding to your texts, I'm probably in the middle of nowhere enjoying the lack of technology\n![](/img/pemi.png)\n*I've backpacked this entire ridge line, picture from the opposing ridge line. Pemigewasset Wilderness, NH*\n\n\n![](/img/me_climbing.jpeg)\n*Red River Gorge*\n\n-----\n\nI started this website back in 2020 (I was 16) as `mee42.dev`. I was trying to find a universal username with <=5 characters and universal availability. Figuring out how to tell it to people in real life was the hard part.\n\nThe server it ran on actually lived on the wall of my parent's basement for a couple years.\n![](/img/server.png)\n\nThen it was moved to my parent's old desktop, a Dell Studio Slim named `sorber` (released 2009) (right), for several years, before ending up on my friend [evelyn](https://evelynmau.de/)'s 2U box (left). Pictured are the two servers connected with a 10Gbps fiber link to bulk-transfer files.\n\n![](/img/sorber.png)"}},"__N_SSG":true}
