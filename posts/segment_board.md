(There will be a writeup here, but it is currently finals week)

There will also be a rev2 of this board that we put into production.
The rev1 board has been made and firmware development is in progress as of right now!

The rev2 boards should have much neater traces lined out.
We had to rush the rev1 order to get in before the JLCPCB holiday, so we didn't have time to perfect it.
